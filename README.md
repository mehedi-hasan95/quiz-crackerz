What have I done?

Quiz: First of all I said this is a quiz website. Here you can take some quizzes for free. These quizzes are loaded from an API. And the entire website is built using React.

Statistics: You can see how many quizzes there are by going to the “Statistics” menu. You can see there are some grafts, which will show you some information when you mouse over them.

Blog: This is a simple blog page. Here are three important questions for React and their answers in "accordion" form.

How to attend the quiz?
This is a very simple task. You can view some of the quizzes by visiting the home page or the "Topics" page. There you can see if it's a related quiz, how many questions there are, etc. There is a button called “Attend Quiz”. Clicking on it will take you to the quiz page.

How to know the answer to the quiz?
Clicking on the quiz option will show a message on the screen. If it is correct then you will get a message, and if it is wrong you will get a message that there was an error. If you want to see the answer to the question, you can click on the “eye” icon next to the question to see the correct answer.
